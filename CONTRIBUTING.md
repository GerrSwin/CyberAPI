# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project.

This is a small, focused application built with the goal of staying
lightweight, predictable, and under the user’s control.
Please keep this in mind when proposing changes.

---

## Philosophy

This project intentionally avoids feature bloat.

Every change should earn its place by answering a simple question:

> Does this make the application simpler, faster, or more reliable?

If the answer is unclear, the change probably does not belong here —  
but questions, alternative ideas, and discussions are always welcome.

If you’re unsure, feel free to open an issue to talk it through before
starting any implementation.

## What contributions are welcome

Contributions that align well with the project’s goals include:

- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- UX simplifications
- Removal of unnecessary complexity
- Documentation improvements
- Maintenance updates (dependencies, tooling)

Small, focused pull requests are preferred over large, sweeping changes.

## What this project tries to avoid

To keep the project sustainable and focused, the following are generally
out of scope:

- Feature bloat or “all-in-one” functionality
- Mandatory accounts, logins, or external services
- Heavy abstractions that add cognitive or runtime overhead
- Complex configuration for simple use cases

If you’re unsure whether an idea fits, consider opening an issue first.
